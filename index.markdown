## Workplace Integrated Classroom

Workplace Integrated Classroom is a teaching method that provides students with a close to industry workplace experience while still maintianing the comfort of the classroom and support of faculty and students.

WIC prioritizes individual student leaning journeys and engagement over evaluation.

### Classroom Environment

In a Workplace Integrated Classroom, the classroom environment is designed to mimic that of a typical workplace:

1. Students are treated more like new employees than students.
2. Classes are longer to more closely resemble a full workday.
3. There are no lectures, assignments, homework, or tests.
4. Students are arranged into teams with rotating team leaders.
5. Students are taught by  being assigned progressively harder and harder tasks.

### Timeline

Workplace Integrated Classroom (WIC) is designed to structure a single semester long course in a typical post-secondary education environment. WIC could be used to structure many classes over a multi-semester program or as little as a set period of time within a single course in a single semester. However, integrating this method into anything less than a six week period may prove to be difficult. 

### Difficulties

The largest barrier to implementing WIC is the requirement for an industy partner (or an internal deparment) with a project large enough to *employ* a complete class of students over 14 weeks. 

### How is this Different than other Teaching Methods?

WIC has many similarities to other teaching methods:

#### Project Based Learning

Project Based Learning (PBL) is a teaching method in which students learn by "actively engaging in real-world and personally meaningful projects" (PBLWorks, n.d.). 

WIC has similar qualities to that of PBL in that both are project based. However, WIC works best with an industry partner and multiple on-going industry projects. This allows students to contribute to multiple projects of varying difficulty and at veriying satges where PBL typical has students all working on the same simulated project from start to finish.

#### Work Baed Learning 

Work Based Leanring (WBL) is defined as "acquiring technical, academic, and employability skills by working in real work environments" (CEWIL Canada, n.d.).

WIC has similar qualities to that of WBL in that both integrate with the workplace. WBL typically sends students out into the workplace to learn in a real work environment, whereas WIC integrates real world work into the classroom. This provides students with a less intimidating learning environment with the immediate support of faculty and fellow students. 

WBL also typically requires students to be near the end of their program whereaas WIC can be inpemented in day one of a program.

### Case Study

This teaching method was initially designed within a Workshops course in a Web Development program at Humber College, in Toronto, Canada.

> Workshops  
> This course will allow students to access additional support for content delivered in the other classes each semester. Every student in the class will engage in a process of self-assessment to help them identify areas where they would benefit from help, and then the student and teaching team will set up a process for providing support for any areas where the student would benefit from some in-the-moment support. Mentors, tutors and workshops will be available.


In a typical Canadian college semester, made up of fourteen weeks, a timeline would look like this:

#### Weeks 1 to 3

Students are onboard and introduced to the workplace process, guidelines, and project management tools.

#### Weeks 4 to 6

Students are placed in groups with rotating team leaders. Over the three weeks groups are assigned progressivly more and more difficult tasks reinforcing processes from the first wek weeks. 

#### Weeks 7 to 14

Students are assigned tasks based on their skilset and desire to learn. Each week class is started with a stand up style meeting.

and then complete assigned task which progressively become more difficult. This format provides students with as close to a real-world work environment as possible while still maintaining the comfort of the classroom and the support of fellow students and faculty.

Workong on someone else's code is a sill often found lacking in new grads.


In this research project we modify a programming course to closely resemble that of a typical software startup development environment. The software being developed in this research project is called BrickMMO: a Smart City Development Platform for use with LEGO bricks. 

In this course format students are treated more like employees than students. Classes are longer to more closely resemble a full workday. There are no lectures, assignments, homework, or tests. During the first few weeks, students are on boarded by being introduced to the development process, programming guidelines, and project management tools. For the reminder of the semester students are organized into teams, participate in stand-up style meetings, and then complete assigned task which progressively become more difficult. This format provides students with as close to a real-world work environment as possible while still maintaining the comfort of the classroom and the support of fellow students and faculty.
