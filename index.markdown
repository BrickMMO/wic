## Workplace Integrated Classroom

Workplace Integrated Classroom is a teaching method that provides students with a close to industry workplace experience while still maintianing the comfort of the classroom and support of faculty and students.

WIC prioritizes individual growth over evaluation, learn by doing over lectures, and individual student learning journeys over learning outcomes.

### Classroom Environment

In a Workplace Integrated Classroom (WIC), the classroom environment is designed to mimic that of a typical workplace:

1. Students are treated more like new employees than students.
2. Classes are longer to more closely resemble a full workday.
3. There are no lectures, assignments, homework, or tests.
4. Students are arranged into teams with rotating team leaders.
5. Students are taught by being assigned progressively harder and harder tasks.

### Timeline

Workplace Integrated Classroom (WIC) is designed to be implemented over a complete semester in a typical post-secondary education environment. WIC could be used to structure as much as a multi-semester program or as little as a set period of time within a single course in a single semester. However, integrating this method into anything less than a six week period may prove to be difficult.

### Difficulties

The largest barrier to implementing Workplace Integrated Classroom (WIC) is the requirement for an industy partner (or an internal deparment) with a project large enough to _employ_ a complete class of students for over 14 weeks.

### How is this Different than other Teaching Methods?

Workplace Integrated Classroom (WIC) has many similarities to other teaching methods:

#### Project Based Learning

Project Based Learning (PBL) is a teaching method in which students learn by "actively engaging in real-world and personally meaningful projects" (PBLWorks, n.d.).

WIC has similar qualities to that of PBL in that both are project based. PBL typical has many students working on the same simulated project from start to finish. WIC works best with an industry partner and multiple on-going industry projects. This allows students to contribute to multiple projects of varying difficulty and at veriying stages.

#### Work Baed Learning

Work Based Learning (WBL) is defined as "acquiring technical, academic, and employability skills by working in real work environments" (CEWIL Canada, n.d.).

WIC has similar qualities to that of WBL in that both integrate with the workplace. WBL typically sends students out into the workplace to learn in a real work environment. WIC integrates real world work into the classroom. This provides students with a less intimidating learning environment with the immediate support of faculty and fellow students. WBL also typically requires students to be near the end of their program whereaas WIC can be inpemented in day one of a program.

### Case Study

This teaching method was initially designed within Web Development program at Humber College, in Toronto, Canada.

Students enrolled in this program have varying degree of previous experience with coding ranging from absolute coding beginners to recent graduates of university computer science programs.

WIC was integrated into a Workshops course. This is a first semester course. A typical Canadian college semester is fourteen weeks. Workshops course description:

> Workshops  
> This course will allow students to access additional support for content delivered in the other classes each semester. Every student in the class will engage in a process of self-assessment to help them identify areas where they would benefit from help, and then the student and teaching team will set up a process for providing support for any areas where the student would benefit from some in-the-moment support. Mentors, tutors and workshops will be available.

The industry parter was [BrevisRefero](https://www.brevisrefero.com/), a BioPharma software start-up located close to Toronto, Canada. The project was [BrickMMO](https://brickmmo.com/), a smart city development platform built with LEGOÂ® bricks. The main instructor was [Adam Thomas](https://codeadam.ca/).

The following is the timeline used to inegrate WIC:

#### Weeks 1 to 3 - Onboarding

Students are onboarded and introduced to the workplace process, guidelines, and project management tools. This included:

1. GitHub and Git
   These are tools that enable collaboration on coding projects.
2. Flow
   A basic custom project management application. Students can log in, receive projects tasks, ask questions, log hours, etc...
3. Discord
   A comminication tool where students are placed in groups based on projects, can chat with other students, share files, etc...
4. [BrickMMO branding guidelines](https://branding.brickmmo.com/), [Tidy](https://tidy.brickmmo.com/), [eplus](https://eplus.codeadam.ca/), and [\_readme](https://readme.codeadam.ca/) programming guidelines.

Tasks included:

1. Installing required software ([Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
2. Registering for required accounts and completing profiles ([GitHub](https://cli.github.com/), [Flow](https://flow.brickmmo.com/), [Discord](https://discord.com/)).

#### Weeks 4 to 6 - Individual Tasks

Students are assigned simple tasks that can be completed as individuals. Students were placed in groups only to suppot each other. Over the three weeks the tasks increased in difficulty. Tasks included:

1. Making basic changes to BrickMMO online assets using simple laguages such as [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
2. Participating in BrickMMO related hackathons and brainstorming sessions.

#### Weeks 7 to 14

Students are placed in groups and assigned tasks based on their skillset and desire to learn. Each week class is started with a stand up style meeting and then students are given time to work on their projects. Projects include:

1. Contributing to the development of the official [BrickMMO website](https://brickmmo.com/). This is a more advance task which requires understanding of [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [React](https://react.dev/), and [MUI](https://mui.com/).
2. Contributing to the improvement of [Flow](https://flow.brickmmo.com/). This is a medium difficulty task whcih requires basic understanding ot [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), and [CSS]((https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).
3. Contributing to basic online assets such as [Pseudocoide](https://pseudocode.codeadam.ca/), [Contributions](https://contributions.brickmmo.com/), and [Conversions](https://conversions.brickmmo.com). These are introductory level tasks which require no previous coding expereince. They will be coded using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
