## Workplace Integrated Learning

Project Based Learning (PBL) is a teaching method in which students learn by actively engaging in real-world and personally meaningful projects (citation). Work Based Learning (WBL) is defined as the development and assessment of skills within the workplace (citation). What if there was a term that defined learning that occurred somewhere in between PBL and WBL?

In this research project we modify a programming course to closely resemble that of a typical software startup development environment. The software being developed in this research project is called BrickMMO: a Smart City Development Platform for use with LEGO bricks. In this course format students are treated more like employees than students. Classes are longer to more closely resemble a full workday. There are no lectures, assignments, homework, or tests. During the first few weeks, students are on boarded by being introduced to the development process, programming guidelines, and project management tools. For the reminder of the semester students are organized into teams, participate in stand-up style meetings, and then complete assigned task which progressively become more difficult. This format provides students with as close to a real-world work environment as possible while still maintaining the comfort of the classroom and the support of fellow students and faculty.
